# Microbit Rock Paper Scissors

A multiplayer rock, paper, scissors game recreated for the Microbit card. This game is a simple 2 player game. This game was made in my first year of highschool during a school project, it was designed to work on a card that has 2 buttons, an accelerometer, and a 5x5 LED screen.

## 📖 Installation

* Own 2 Microbit cards
* Paste `game.py` on your Microbit editor
* Flash both Microbit cards approximately at the same time
* Wait until the yellow LEDs on both cards stop flashing
* Follow the instructions below to play

## 📄 Instructions

* The game will start with an animation (if it bothers you, delete everything from `Introduction animation at the beginning of the game` until right before the `while` loop in the `game.py` script)
* Once the animation has completed, you can choose your move:
    - Pressing A will play rock
    - Pressing B will play paper
    - Shaking will play scissors
* The winner is awarded a crown and the loser an X, in case of a draw, both players get a circle

> [!NOTE]
> I recommend shaking the card no matter what so you don't let your opponent know your next move, remember to press the A or B button before shaking (if you want to play rock or paper).
