# Microbit Rock Paper Scissors

A multiplayer rock, paper, scissors game recreated for the Microbit card. This game is a  r e v o l u t i o n a r y  2 player game. This game was made last year for a school project, it was designed to work on a card that has 2 buttons, an accelerometer, and a 9x9 LED screen.

## ⚙️ Installation

* Own 2 Microbit cards
* Paste `game.py` on your Microbit editor
* Flash both Microbit cards at the same time
* Wait until the yellow LEDs on both cards stop flashing
* Follow the instructions below to play

## 📃 Instructions

* The game will start with an animation (if it bothers you just delete everything from `Introduction animation at the beginning of the game` until the while loop)
* After the animation, you will have to choose a move:
    - Press A: rock
    - Press B: paper
    - Shake: scissors
* P.S. I reccommend shaking the card no matter what so you don't tell your opponent your move in advance, just think about pressing the A or B button before shaking if you want to play rock or paper
* The winner is awarded a crown and the loser an X, in case of a draw you both get a circle
