<h1>Microbit Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
A multiplayer rock, paper, scissors game recreated for the Microbit card. This game is a simple 2 player game. This game was made in my first year of highschool during a school project, it was designed to work on a card that has 2 buttons, an accelerometer, and a 5x5 LED screen.

<div align=center style="text-align: center;"><h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2></div>

* The game will start with an animation (if it bothers you, delete everything from `Introduction animation at the beginning of the game` until right before the `while` loop in the `game.py` script)
* Once the animation has completed, you can choose your move:
    - Press A: rock
    - Press B: paper
    - Shake: scissors
* The winner is awarded a crown and the loser an X, in case of a draw, both players get a circle
* P.S. I reccommend shaking the card no matter what so you don't let your opponent know your next move, remember to press the A or B button before shaking (if you want to play rock or paper)
